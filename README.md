# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Project for Getting and Cleaning Data on Coursera

This project contains run_analysis.R, which computes the mean of each feature in the UCI HAR Dataset (found [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip))
for each subject and for each activity.

To use run_analysis.R, first download and extract the zip file from the above link into this directory and execute run_analysis.R to create tiddy.txt, a dataset containing the above mentioned results.

For more information on how the dataset relates to tiddy.txt, please refer to [cookbook.md](cookbook.md).
